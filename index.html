        <h1>You've Been Invited To Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!</h1>
        <p>Dear Mr/Miss._________________,
        </p>
        <p>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!
            Term begins on September first. We await your owl no later than July 31.


        </p>
        <p>Sincerly,</p>
        <p>Professer McGonagall,
        </p>
        <p>Deputy Headmistress</p>

        <h1>Welcome To Hogwarts!</h1>

        <p>You've reached Hogwarts! After a long ride on the Hogwarts Express, you hear the
            Keeper of Keys, Hagrid calling for the first-years. That includes YOU!
            You walk toward the magnificent boats, were you see the magnificent Hogwarts 
            Castle for the first time ever, and it is breathtaking!
            When you reach the castle doors, a strict looking Professer McGonagall leads
            you into the Great Hall, and instructs you to wait until your name is called, 
            but first, the Sorting Hat has a song to share. . . 
        </p>
        <h2>The Sorting Hat Song </h2>
        <h4>By J.K. Rowling</h4>
        <h5>Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone</h5>
        <p>"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,</p>
        <p>But don't judge on what you see,</p>
    <p>I'll eat myself if you can find</p>
    <p>A smarter hat than me</p>
    <p>You can keep you bowlers back,</p>
    <p> Your top hats sleek and tall,</p>
    <p>For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat</p>
    <p>And I can cap them all</p>
    <p>There's nothing hidden in your head</p>
    <p>The Sorting Hat can't see</p>
    <p>So try me on and I will tell you</p>
    <p>Where you ought to be</p>
    <p>You might belong in Gryffindor</p>
    <p>Where dwell the brave at heart</p>
    <p>Their daring, nerve, and chivalry</p>
    <p>Set Gryffindors apart;</p>
    <p>You might belong in Hufflepuff</p>
    <p>Where they are just and loyal</p>
    <p>Those Hufflepuffs are true </p>
    <p>And unafraid of toil;</p>
    <p>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,</p>
    <p>If you've a ready mind</p>
    <p>Where those of wit and learning,</p>
    <p>Will always find their kind;</p>
    <p>Or perhaps in Slytherin</p>
    <p>You'll make your real friends,</p>
    <p>Those cunning folk use any means</p>
    <p>To achieve their ends</p>
    <p>So put me on! Don't be afraid!</p>
    <p>And don't get in a flap!</p>
    <p>You're in safe hands (though I have none)</p>
    <p>For I'm a Thinking Cap!</p>
